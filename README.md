## Overview

The **AI Calculator Website** is a powerful web application designed to help users solve mathematical problems using AI-driven technology. This tool allows users to draw their math problems on a canvas, which the AI then analyzes to provide solutions, making it an intuitive and flexible platform for tackling a variety of math-related queries.

## Features

- **Canvas Drawing**: Users can draw their math problems on a digital canvas.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: The AI interprets the drawn image and provides accurate mathematical solutions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive UI built using modern web technologies.

## Built With

- **Python**: Backend server logic.
- **Google Gemini**: AI-based features.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building interactive UI components.
- **Vite**: Development environment for a fast, optimized build process.

## Frameworks

- Python (Python is a powerful and versatile programming language used for the backend of this application. It handles server-side logic, processes AI-powered requests, and manages the core functionality of the AI that interprets mathematical problems from the canvas)


- Google Gemini (Google Gemini is a robust AI platform that powers the machine learning capabilities of this application. It processes the images drawn by the users and generates mathematical solutions based on the problem it identifies)


- React (React is a popular JavaScript library used to build the dynamic, responsive frontend of the AI Calculator Website. It ensures a smooth user experience by rendering the interactive UI components like the canvas where users can draw their math problems)


- Vite (Vite is a modern build tool that is faster and leaner than traditional tools like Webpack. It optimizes the development workflow by providing fast, hot-reloading and efficient builds for the frontend React components)
